      <b>Problem space:</b> We found that GT students are facing challenges with the healthcare system available to them. 
      This is a significant issue as we found varied problems in the healthcare system: students are delaying healthcare treatment, 
      having difficulties scheduling an appointment, having trouble balancing academics and health, and do not have financial literacy about insurance 
      and healthcare costs. It is important to have a more efficient healthcare system for students and provide students with an overall better experience 
      with healthcare.
    </p>

    <p style="font-family: 'Imprima'; font-size: 15px;">
        <b>User Group:</b> GT students who use on-campus and off-campus healthcare services.

            From interview and survey data, we found that the main 3 issues with the healthcare system on campus for GT students are the following:
            <ol style="font-family: 'Imprima'; font-size:15px;">
                <li>Difficulties scheduling appointments that work with a student’s schedule</li>

        </p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Imprima'; font-size:15px;">
            We came up with the following project goals:

                <li>Create a user-friendly and user-centered mobile application</li>

                <li>Developing an efficient system that provides users with a simpler way of managing healthcare information</li>

          As part of the ideation process, we then came up with three personas to represent different types of users within the Georgia Tech

          to be more empathetic and ensure that the final designs would effectively address the various challenges students would face when accessing

          After exploring varying solutions and creating personas, we decided it would best to create a mobile student healthcare application.
          We felt that a mobile application was best suited because it is immediately accessible to students since the user-group is almost always
          on their phones so they can take quick action on their healthcare needs. It would also allow for emergency procedures to be taken care of immediately
          since students would have access to 911 on their cellphones along with the integrated use of google maps.
